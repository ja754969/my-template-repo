## Overview
This repository is a reusable **research project template** combining Python and MATLAB workflows.  
It includes starter scripts, configurations, and documentation best practices to enable reproducible research.

---

## Features
- Python and MATLAB starter code for typical research workflows  
- `.gitignore` configured for code, documents, images, and large files management  
- Recommended project structure for data, scripts, results, and documentation  
- Citation and licensing guidance for academic use  
- Contribution guidelines optimized for collaborative research  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x ([Download & install](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  
- MATLAB (compatible version)  
- Git  
- (Optional) Virtual environment tools (`venv` or `conda`)  

### Creating a New Research Project

## Usage

### Python

Run analysis scripts in the `python/` folder:

```

python python/analysis.py

```

### MATLAB

Start MATLAB and run scripts in the `matlab/` folder:

```

run matlab/analyze.m

```

---

## Data Management

- Store raw data in `data/raw/` and processed data in `data/processed/`.  
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude large data files and sensitive data if necessary.  
- Consider using Git LFS or external repositories for very large datasets.
